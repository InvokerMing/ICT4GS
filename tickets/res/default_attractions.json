    "history": {
      "en": "Kraton Surakarta Hadiningrat, located in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia, is the palace of the Sunanate of Surakarta, established in 1745 by Pakubuwono II after the division of the Mataram Sultanate in 1755. As one of the principal Javanese palaces, it served as the center of Javanese culture, spirituality, and politics. The palace architecture is a blend of traditional Javanese design and European influences. Although some parts were damaged by fire in 1985 and subsequently rebuilt, the Kraton retains its historical importance and houses many valuable artifacts. Today, a section of the palace functions as a museum, displaying royal collections including artifacts, gamelan instruments, and historical photographs, offering visitors a glimpse into the life and grandeur of the Javanese royalty. The palace and its surrounding area remain a focal point for local cultural activities and traditions.",
